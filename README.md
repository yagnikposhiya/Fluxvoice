# Fluxvoice
Open-source Voice-AI Reliability Infrastructure with a built-in agent runtime, real-world scenario testing, full call evaluation, and an automated agent-improvement engine.

## Problem
AI agents perform well in test environments, but once deployed in production they often break. Enterprises have no way to see which calls failed, why they failed, or where the breakdown occurred. As a result, voice AI agents rarely scale beyond pilot projects.

## Solution
FluxVoice automatically generates real-world test scenarios before deployment, evaluates every production call to identify failures and their causes, and continuously analyzes these failures to feed fixes back into the system.
